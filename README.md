ML CONCEPTS WITH EXAMPLE

1. Z-Test: Used to check if there’s a difference between the mean of a sample and the population mean when the population variance is known.

2. F-Test: Used to compare variances between two groups to see if they are significantly different.

3. ANOVA: Compares means across three or more groups to determine if at least one group mean is different from the others. It uses the F-test to assess differences.

4. T-Test: Used to compare the means of two groups to see if they’re significantly different. It’s commonly applied when the sample size is small, and population variance is unknown.

Types:
* Independent T-Test: Compares means of two independent groups.
* Paired T-Test: Compares means within the same group at different times.
  
5. Chi-square Test: Used to examine relationships between categorical variables to see if they’re independent or related.

Types:
* Chi-square Test for Independence: Checks if there’s a relationship between two categorical variables.
* Chi-square Goodness-of-Fit Test: Checks if the observed frequencies match expected frequencies.
